// NOTE: This file is empty 
// It was formerly used as a support file for older versions of PHPMailer, but is now handled differently.

// This file is present only to avoid triggering errors in old implementations.

// You REALLY should be doing a proper complete upgrade of your Zen Cart version,
// because your current version of Zen Cart is NOT compatible with modern PHP versions,
// and numerous bugfixes have been included in newer versions.

// You may delete this file after you have upgraded to at least Zen Cart v1.5.5c or newer.
