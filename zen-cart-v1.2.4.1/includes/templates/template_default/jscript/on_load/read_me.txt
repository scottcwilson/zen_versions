Another example of Zen Magic.
This directory is called on_load and therefore an on_load.php file in this directory can be used to modify the body tag with
a javascript on_load function.

Just name the file "on_load.php" and store it in this folder.

The effect is like this:

<body onload="WHATEVER_YOUR_FILE_CONTAINS_GOES_HERE">


This will affect EVERY page in your site.
